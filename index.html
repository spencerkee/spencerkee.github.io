Quick description of sleep accountability system:

Problem: I often suffer from revenge bedtime procrastination and end up going to sleep much later than I would like. 

Solution: As a first option I can use Beeminder to a bedtime deadline. If I miss logging that I'm in bed by the deadline then I pay some amount of money. The issue is that this system has little accountability. I could log that I'm in bed without that being the case, lying to myself is easy. However, lying to another person feels less conscionable to me so looping another person into the system would go a ways in preventing cheating.

I set up a sleeping-on-time competition with someone I know who has a similar issue. The system is arbitrated by recording when one goes to bed through a form, which displays who went to sleep first. Times logged before 11pm are treated as being logged at 11pm to avoid an unpleasant race to the bottom where we end up sleeping at 6pm or something to win. The first person to achieve 10 wins gets dinner bought for them on the other person's dime.

To make the system easier and more "delightful" to use, I created iOS shortcuts to POST to the form with one click (or voice command!) and also text the other person the current score to rub it in their face a little. 

I think the two problems I see are 1) the lack of incentive to subsequently quickly go to sleep if someone goes to sleep first 2) a potential lack of incentive if someone is way ahead and you think you can’t catch up (this doesn't affect me personally but for others it might).

My proposal to solve 1) is the system becomes points based, based on the difference between when you and I go to sleep. E.g. if the opponent goes to sleep at 11 and I go to sleep at 12:05 they get 65 points (based on minutes elapsed, maybe up to a maximum). Times before 11pm are treated as 11pm, ties are 0 points. The normal way to end things would be option a) compete on a first to let’s say ~600 point basis.

So you can see if someone goes to sleep before you, you're still incentivized to do the same, and also incentivized to go to sleep as close to 11 as possible in a more tangible way to maximize points

To solve 2) (which may not be a problem), there could be a win condition option b) instead based on being up by e.g. 120 points at any time instead of competing for a set number. That way it can go indefinitely easier (which is sort of a goal), and you have to be on your toes because there’s never a very far distance to catch up. 

E.g. I can just do what I do now which is not really worry until you’re at 8/10 points then just turn up the gas and go to sleep at 11pm every day until I’m caught up.

There’s a similar system in the game apex legends which is pretty elegant where instead of teams playing first to 9 where you could be stomped for 9 games in a row by a much better team, it’s first to 3, win by 2, maximum 9. So if you get stomped the first 3 games that’s just it. But you can have long close games where it’s like 9-9 if you’re evenly matched. But it could also end at any time at like 5-7 so you have to be on your toes
